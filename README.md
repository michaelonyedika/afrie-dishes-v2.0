# Afrie-dishes-v2.0

Afrie Dishes is a landing page showcasing beautiful African food recipes. As a Frontend Developer, I built the site using React for dynamic interfaces and Tailwind CSS for flexible styling. The site is deployed on Vercel, ensuring fast and reliable performance. Afrie Dishes offers an engaging and visually appealing experience for users exploring African cuisine.
